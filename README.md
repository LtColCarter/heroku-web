# How to use website

* Sidebar on left has the different categories for recipes. Pressing them will bring up random recipes of the specific category.
* If you click on the different recipe headers they will popout and reveal more information about the recipe. This stops clutter on the homepage and huge blocks of text. (Sadly I didn't have time to get pictures of each recipe to come up with the text.)
* The "Add a new recipe" form is below the top part of the website, click on the "Add a new recipe" will take you down to it. When you fill it out, you have to click each of the submit buttons.
* Think the rest is pretty self-explanatory. The recipes that appear on the front page are randomised when you click on certain buttons.

## API Details

* API is pretty easy to understand I have multiple lists for certain details. Any POST requests just adds to the lists to allow them to be called and presented on the webpage at a later date.

## __Eslint__

* My .eslintrc.json specification file is attached. Just type in `npm install` once you've navigated to my folder in the CMD/Terminal and then just type `eslint [file name]` where the file name is one of; `app.js`, `index.js` or maybe `server.js`.

## __Cloud Deployment__

* Go to [https://cryptic-cove-34092.herokuapp.com/](https://cryptic-cove-34092.herokuapp.com/) to try out the cloud deployment of this web server. The HTTP requests are slightly slower seeing as they are being sent further than just your local machine!
